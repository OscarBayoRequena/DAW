            <spawn>
                Bats can spawn in groups of 8‌[JE only]/2‌[BE only] in the Overworld at a light level of 3 or less on opaque blocks below layer 63, they also need at least 2 air blocks. In Java Edition, between October 20 and November 3, they require a light level of 6 or less to spawn. On Superflat worlds, bats spawn below the top non-air layer, ignoring the usual layer-63 limitation.

                Cats are tameable passive mobs that are found in villages and swamp huts. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Villages

                Untamed cats spawn in villages as long as there is at least one villager and four beds. One cat spawns for every four valid beds, with a maximum of 10 cats.

                Cats can spawn every 1200 ticks (1 minute) in a village (5 occupied beds). A random player is selected (including spectators), a random location 8-32 blocks in +/- x/z (based on player location) is chosen and if that is less than 2 chunks from a village with less than 5 cats, a cat spawns there.

                in Bedrock Edition, a village periodically spawns stray cats to fill a quota of 1 cat per 4 owned beds, up to a maximum of 5 cats for 20 or more owned beds. Only owned beds (those currently claimed by a villager) are counted for this purpose. All cats within the village boundaries are counted, including kittens, cats that wander in from outside, and even tamed cats owned by a player. If the number of cats found is short of the quota, the village tries to spawn one cat or kitten within a volume of 16 × 6 × 16 blocks centered on the village center. (This is the same volume used when a village spawns an iron golem.)
                Swamp Hut

                One untamed black cat generates alongside a witch inside swamp huts upon world generation. This cat never despawns. Additional black cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches, however require a grass block to do so. Any other cats to spawn within the witch hut (from spawn eggs, breeding and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black.
                Bedrock Edition
                25% of cats spawn as kittens. During a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.

            <spawn>
                Chickens spawn naturally in the overworld in groups of four on grass blocks[a] with 2 blocks of free space above it at a light level of 9 or more.

                Chickens are more common in jungle hills, jungle edges and modified jungle edges.‌[JE only]

                After the world generation, they spawn individually.

                5% of chickens spawn as babies.

                They require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and are found in groups of two to four.‌[BE only]
                Chicken Jockey
                Java Edition
                Main article: Chicken Jockey

                All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey. Because a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%. A chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command:

                /summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {isChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:"minecraft:zombie",IsBaby:1b}]}

                Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.
                Bedrock Edition
                Baby zombie jockeys no longer spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking a player, wandering trader, adult villager, snow golem or iron golem.

                A donkey is a mob that can be ridden when tamed. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                1-3 donkeys spawn in plains and only 1 in savannas. 20% of the individual donkeys spawn as foals.
                Bedrock Edition

                2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.
                Appearance

                Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.

                Donkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.

                Unlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of Invisibility. This will not be fixed.[1]

                Mules do not spawn naturally, but they can spawn through cross-breeding a horse with a donkey. Mules cannot breed with other mules. 20% of mule spawn eggs produce foals.

                Ocelots are rare passive mobs found in jungles. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Ocelots spawn above grass blocks or leaves at sea level (y=63 per default) or higher in groups of 1 or 2. These are mostly adults but sometimes ocelots spawn as a kitten. When an adult ocelot spawns, there is a 1⁄7 chance for 2 ocelot kittens to spawn with it; this chance includes any kind of spawning, including spawning naturally, by a spawn egg or a mob spawner.
                Java Edition

                There is a 1⁄3 chance for a spawn attempt to fail in jungles and 100% in bamboo jungles or jungle edges. While ocelots are passive mobs, natural spawning considers the hostile mob cap rather than the much-lower (ten times less) passive mob cap.[1]
                Bedrock Edition
                Ocelots are found in all kinds of jungles.

                In Java Edition, pufferfish spawn in groups of 1-3 in warm, lukewarm and deep lukewarm ocean biomes. In Bedrock Edition, fish spawn underwater at around 12–32 blocks away from the player in groups of 3–5 in warm ocean biomes. Pufferfish spawn only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top.

                A rabbit is an uncommon passive mob. Rabbits are a source of rabbit's foot, rabbit hide, and raw rabbit. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Creamy rabbits are common and are found only in deserts and in their variants with oases.

                Other rabbit colors are rarer and found in flower forests, taigas, and snowy biomes.

                In all these places, groups of an adult and one to two babies spawn.

                Rabbits spawn on either Grass Block, Snow[1], or Sand.

                In flower forests from Bedrock Edition, up to three kits spawn and are common. Also for this game version, rabbits spawn in frozen watery biomes: snowy beaches, frozen oceans, and legacy frozen oceans.

                For Java Edition, rabbits are also found in giant tree taigas.

                In taigas, wolves and foxes are also found. If left alone, these may quickly kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery, and icy biomes.

                The Killer Bunny does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the /summon command, although it is exclusive to Java Edition.

                A rabbit is an uncommon passive mob. Rabbits are a source of rabbit's foot, rabbit hide, and raw rabbit. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Creamy rabbits are common and are found only in deserts and in their variants with oases.

                Other rabbit colors are rarer and found in flower forests, taigas, and snowy biomes.

                In all these places, groups of an adult and one to two babies spawn.

                Rabbits spawn on either Grass Block, Snow[1], or Sand.

                In flower forests from Bedrock Edition, up to three kits spawn and are common. Also for this game version, rabbits spawn in frozen watery biomes: snowy beaches, frozen oceans, and legacy frozen oceans.

                For Java Edition, rabbits are also found in giant tree taigas.

                In taigas, wolves and foxes are also found. If left alone, these may quickly kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery, and icy biomes.

                The Killer Bunny does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the /summon command, although it is exclusive to Java Edition.

            <spawn>
                Java Edition

                Salmon spawn in groups of 1–5 in cold or frozen oceans, as well as their deep variants. They also spawn in rivers and frozen rivers.
                Bedrock Edition
                Salmon spawn underwater at 12–32 blocks away from the player. Salmon spawn in groups of 3–5 in lukewarm, cold, normal, frozen oceans, their deep variants and rivers (including frozen rivers). In addition, salmon spawn on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top). Salmon spawn in small, normal, and large sizes. 31.5% spawn as small, 52.6% spawn as normal, and 15.7% spawn as large.

                Skeleton horses are undead variants of regular horses. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Skeleton horses spawn only from "skeleton traps”.

                A "skeleton trap" horse is a skeleton horse spawned from a fraction of lightning strikes during a thunderstorm or by chance (0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.25–6.75% on Hard, depending on regional difficulty). It despawns after 15 minutes if not triggered.

                When a player comes within 10 blocks of the skeleton trap horse, lightning strikes it. This lightning cannot start fires or damage nearby entities. When struck, the skeleton trap horse transforms into a skeleton horseman: a skeleton riding a skeleton horse. It also spawns three additional skeleton horsemen in the vicinity.

                A snow golem is a snowman-like utility mob that helps defend against hostile and neutral mobs.
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                To create a snow golem, the player must stack two snow blocks, and then place, or dispense, a carved pumpkin, a jack o'lantern or an uncarved pumpkin‌[Bedrock Edition only]. The building pattern can also work when arranged sideways or upside-down, as long as the pumpkin is the last one placed. The player can also place the pattern in any order with an uncarved pumpkin, then use shears on the pumpkin to create a snow golem.

                The snow golem spawns at the location of the pumpkin when created horizontally

                Endermen are capable of creating snow golems by placing the necessary blocks, although this is an extremely rare event because they do not do so deliberately.[1]

                Striders are passive mobs native to the Nether. They can walk/stride on lava and be saddled by the player. A warped fungus on a stick is needed to control a strider, similar to how a pig is controlled by a carrot on a stick. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                In the Nether, two to four striders spawn on spaces of lava that are two blocks tall with an air block above. Because striders are the only passive mob in the nether, spawning attempts are made every 400 game ticks. For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up. Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider, creating a strider jockey. If this happens, the strider spawns with a saddle and the zombified piglin spawns carrying a warped fungus on a stick. The zombified piglin also does not despawn (except on Peaceful difficulty).

                Tropical Fish are common passive mobs found in oceans. There are 3,584 possible variants. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Java Edition

                In Java Edition, tropical fish spawn in lukewarm, warm and deep lukewarm oceans in groups of 8 at 24 (cylindrical) to 64 (spherical) blocks away from the player, with random patterns (see below).
                Bedrock Edition
                In Bedrock Edition, fish spawn underwater at 12-32 blocks away from the player. Tropical fish spawn only in warm ocean biomes, in groups of 3-5 for the same preset pattern, and in groups of 1-3 for a random pattern. In addition, tropical fish only spawn on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top).

                10% of turtles spawned are babies.

                In Java Edition, turtles spawn at light levels greater than 8 and below 4 blocks above sea level (typically 62), on the sand.

                In Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2–6, at light level 7 or higher, at Y=60–67.

                Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact. Their outfit varies according to their occupation and biome. A player can trade with villagers using emeralds as currency. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Natural generation

                Villagers can be found in villages, which spawn in several biomes such as plains, snowy tundras, savannas, deserts, taigas, and snowy taigas. A cleric villager and cleric zombie villager spawn locked up in the basements of igloos (if the basement generates,) under the carpet of the floor. In Bedrock Edition, the villager and zombie villager inside igloo basements have random professions instead of always being clerics.

                When a zombie villager is cured, it transforms into a villager. The villager retains the profession it had as a zombie, if it had one. Otherwise, it adopts a randomly chosen profession‌[Bedrock Edition only]. The cured villager offers its maximum discount on each of its trades.

                The wandering trader is a passive mob found randomly across the world. It can trade, making natural items more available, less dangerous to obtain, and in some cases, renewable. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                The wandering trader appears randomly across the world with 2 leashed trader llamas. In Bedrock Edition, wandering traders can also spawn near bells.

                At any time, there can be only one wandering trader naturally spawned in loaded chunks. However, it is possible to have more than one wandering trader present by having one spawn in loaded chunks, while having another in unloaded chunks. After 24000 ticks (20 real-life minutes, or 1 Minecraft day) have passed since the world is created, the game attempts to spawn a wandering trader.[note 1] If there are no wandering traders currently in any loaded chunks, the game tries to spawn a new wandering trader after every following 24000 ticks, within a 48-block radius of a player. The first spawn attempt has a 2.5% chance of success; if it fails, after another 24000 ticks another spawn attempt is made with a 5% chance of success. If that fails, for all subsequent spawn attempts the chance caps at 7.5%. On average, it takes 10.411 Minecraft days (or 3.5 real-life hours) for a wandering trader to spawn. After 48000 or 72000 ticks, the trader despawns, even when named, along with its trader llamas, resetting the cycle.

                In Bedrock Edition, when using spawn eggs or the /summon command to spawn a wandering trader, llamas always spawn with it. Wandering traders never spawn if /mobevent minecraft:wandering_trader is set to false.

                In Java Edition, wandering traders never spawn if /gamerule doTraderSpawning is set to false.

                When playing on a remote island, wandering traders usually spawn in the water. The game prefers spawning them on the world surface, but they also spawn underground if the player is sufficiently deep and the spawn volume is large enough.

                Dolphins are neutral mobs that live in non-frozen oceans and grant a speed boost to players that swim near them. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Dolphins are found in groups (pods) of 3-5 in all ocean biomes, except frozen oceans and cold oceans. In Java Edition, they spawn between (exclusively) level 45 and the sea level of the world. Dolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, similar to squid.
				
                10% of dolphins spawn as babies.‌[Bedrock Edition only]

                An Enderman can spawn in areas with light level 7 or less (11 or less in the End) on any solid surface having at least three empty spaces above. They are the only mob that spawns in all 3 dimensions.
                Overworld

                Endermen spawn uncommonly on land and in caves in hauntings (groups) of two. They can rarely spawn in hauntings of three.
                Nether

                Single Endermen spawn rarely in nether wastes and soul sand valleys, and frequently in warped forests.
                End
                Endermen spawn commonly in hauntings of up to four in the end islands. They also spawn frequently on the End's main island. Sometimes, Endermen are found on the end ships floating about the end cities.

            <descripcion>
                An iron golem is a large, strong, neutral utility mob that defends players and villagers. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Villages

                In Java Edition, villagers can summon iron golems, either when they are gossiping or panicking. When a villager tries to summon a golem, up to 10 attempts are made to spawn a golem within a 16×13×16 box centered on the block the villager is standing on (block position +8/-8 blocks along x/z axes and +6/-6 blocks along y axis). A y column is picked and then the topmost block and directly under the sky in that column is selected that is air, water, or lava, and has a "solid-blocking" block underneath, or block at y=+6 if none such is available in that column is selected. The target location is then checked whether the block underneath has a solid top surface (which is not the same as "solid-blocking"). The target block and 2 blocks above must not be a full block, be redstone-powered nor be rails, and the two blocks above must not be water. This means the iron golem can spawn inside 1-deep water or inside blocks like half-slabs, fences, and carpets (if other checks pass). Adjacent blocks are relevant, so golems do spawn partially inside adjacent solid blocks.[1] However, the spawning iron golem still must not collide with any existing entities.

                In Bedrock Edition, an iron golem can spawn naturally when a village first generates in the world. Iron golems also spawn in villages having at least 20 beds and 10 villagers, in a 16×6×16 volume around the village center defined by a bed, a bell, or another meeting point. For a village to spawn iron golems, 75% of the villagers in the village must have worked in the past day, 100% of the villagers must be linked to a bed, and a player must be within 80 blocks of the village horizontally and within 44 blocks vertically. The chance of attempting a spawn is 1⁄700 per game tick, which averages to one spawn attempt every 35 seconds. Iron golems can spawn provided the 2×4×2 space above the spawn point (that is, horizontally centered on the NW corner of the block it spawns on) contains only non-solid blocks, and the block it spawns on is solid. 
				
                Creation
				
                Iron golems are created by placing four iron blocks in a T shape (as shown in the image), and then placing a carved pumpkin, jack o'lantern or pumpkin‌[BE only] on top of the center upper block. The pumpkin may be placed by the player, a dispenser or an enderman, but it must be placed last. It needs space around it to be able to spawn and cannot spawn in a confined area. Alternatively, the blocks can be placed in any order with an uncarved pumpkin; the player can shear the pumpkin to spawn the golem. When successfully transformed, it is naturally passive toward all players under all circumstances. It can, however, attack the player’s tamed wolves, if punched accidentally, but it never directly attacks the player.

                The block arrangement can be placed upright, lying down, or upside-down. The four empty spaces in the diagram (above and below each of the arms) must be air blocks. Any non-air block (including blocks such as snow layers, tall grass, and water) present in any of the empty spaces prevent the golem from spawning.

                Like other constructed mobs, iron golems always spawn facing south. Their large size may cause them to take suffocation damage from nearby solid blocks at the level of their head. 
				
                Pillager outposts
				
                Iron golems can also be found surrounding pillager outposts, confined inside dark oak cages. When freed, they can help the player by attacking any nearby pillagers.

                A panda is a rare mob that resides in jungles whose behavior is neutral, but can sometimes be passive or hostile. Baby pandas and pandas that enter love mode are passive to players. Adult pandas are neutral to players; it is not known if they are also neutral to other mobs.

            <spawn>
                Pandas are very rare and spawn in groups of 1–2 in jungle biomes at the surface on grass blocks with at least two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are a bit more common in bamboo jungles.

                Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal one being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.

                5% of pandas spawn as babies.

                Status effects
				
                On hard difficulty, spiders occasionally spawn with status effects. For each pack spawn, there is a (10×clamped regional difficulty)% chance of the game applying a status effect. This does not apply to cave spiders. If it decides to do so, then it selects the effect. The spider can spawn with following effects:
				
                Speed (40% chance)
                Strength (20% chance)
                Regeneration (20% chance)
                Invisibility (20% chance)
				
                The effect is then applied to all entities within the pack, lasting for about 3.4 years[1] . If the Invisibility status effect is applied to a spider, its eyes remain visible, similar to invisible endermen.

                Zombified piglins are undead, neutral mobs that inhabit the Nether. A zombified piglin becomes hostile when it or another nearby zombified piglin is attacked. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Zombified piglins can spawn in nether wastes and crimson forests, nether portals, from pigs struck by lightning or from piglins or piglin brutes in the Overworld or in the End. They have a 5% chance of spawning as baby zombified piglins. Zombified piglins and piglins do not spawn on top of nether wart blocks or shroomlights.

                A baby zombified piglin has a 5% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey.‌[JE only] An adult zombified piglin can also spawn riding a Strider above lava, holding a Warped Fungus on a Stick.

                All zombified piglins spawn with a golden sword, which has a small chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard modes, up to 25%. This chance varies depending on the regional difficulty as the sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.

                On Halloween (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a pumpkin or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a jack o'lantern equipped as headgear.‌[JE only]
                Nether

                In Java Edition zombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 in the Nether at light level 11 and below; In Bedrock Edition they spawn in groups of 2-4 at all light levels. They spawn most commonly in nether wastes, and nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding a strider in lava oceans.
                Nether portals

                When a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a block tick, there is a chance of 1⁄2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1⁄1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3⁄2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.

                In Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.

                In Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither slabs nor lighting prevents this. "Portal ticking" can be used to increase the rate of zombified Piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.

                Zombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.

                Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.‌[JE only]
                Pigs

                A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig. If the pig is a piglet, then it transforms into a baby zombified piglin.
                Piglins

                A piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or The End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When baby piglins transform into zombies, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn, and when piglin brutes transform into zombies, they keep their axes.

                A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified‌[JE only].

                Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey‌[JE only].

                All zombified piglins spawn with a golden sword, which has a small chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard modes, up to 25%. This chance varies depending on the regional difficulty as the sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.

                On Halloween (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a pumpkin or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a jack o'lantern equipped as headgear.‌[JE only]
                Nether

                In Java Edition zombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 in the Nether at light level 11 and below; In Bedrock Edition they spawn in groups of 2-4 at all light levels. They spawn most commonly in nether wastes, and nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding a strider in lava oceans.
                Nether portals

                When a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a block tick, there is a chance of 1⁄2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1⁄1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3⁄2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.

                In Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.

                In Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither slabs nor lighting prevents this. "Portal ticking" can be used to increase the rate of zombified Piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.

                Zombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.

                Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.‌[JE only]
                Pigs

                A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig. If the pig is a piglet, then it transforms into a baby zombified piglin.
                Piglins

                A piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or The End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When baby piglins transform into zombies, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn, and when piglin brutes transform into zombies, they keep their axes.

                A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified‌[JE only].

                Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey‌[JE only].

                A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and explodes. Due to their distinctive appearance and high potential for killing unwary players as well as damaging the environment and players' constructions, creepers have become one of the icons of Minecraft, both among players and non-players.

                Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well as the only way to obtain most music discs. When struck by lightning, a creeper becomes charged, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained.

                Creepers naturally spawn in the Overworld on solid blocks with a light level of 7 or less.

                Drowned are common underwater zombie variants that spawn in water or when a zombie drowns. They are also the only source of tridents. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Naturally
                An adult drowned and a baby drowned with a trident.

                Drowned spawn naturally at light level of 7 or less in all ocean biomes (except for warm ocean), and river biomes. They spawn at higher rates in rivers than in other biomes.

                in Java Edition drowned spawn in groups of 1 inside flowing water or source water that is 2 blocks or taller.[more information needed] In ocean biomes, drowned spawn at Y above 58, or at least 6 blocks below sea level; this restriction does not apply to rivers.

                in Bedrock Edition drowned spawn in groups of 2–4 inside flowing water or source water of any depth, but they spawn at higher rates in water that is 2 blocks or taller.[more information needed] They spawn only on the surface, that is, on the highest spawnable block at any given X, Z coordinate; other than that they do not have any specific Y-level spawn limitations. They count toward the monster population control cap and also have their own density caps of 5 in oceans and 2 in rivers.

                Drowned have a greater chance of appearing in ruins and cities.

                Drowned have a chance to spawn with either a trident or a fishing rod, and occasionally with a nautilus shell. in Java Edition they also have a small chance of spawning while riding a chicken, even after drowning as a zombie, creating a drowned chicken jockey. They are the only zombie variant within the game that cannot spawn naturally with any armor.
                Ocean ruins

                Drowned spawn during the generation of certain ocean ruin structures. These drowned do not naturally despawn unless the world is set to Peaceful difficulty.
				
                Conversion
                If a zombie's head is submerged in water continuously for 30 seconds, it begins the process of converting to a drowned. It starts shaking, similar to the effect seen while a zombie villager is being cured. At this point, the process cannot be stopped, and 15 seconds later the zombie becomes drowned. The drowned appears with full health even if the previous zombie did not.

                If a zombie is holding or wearing a picked-up item when it becomes drowned, it drops the item it is holding or wearing. Items spawned with the zombie drop with the normal 8.5% +1% per Looting level. In Bedrock Edition only, an item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.

                Zombie villagers do not transform, and husks do not transform instantly; instead, they first transform into a regular zombie, and subsequently convert to a drowned in the usual fashion

                An evoker is a spell-casting illager found in woodland mansions and raids, and is the only source of the totem of undying.

                Woodland mansions

                Individual evokers spawn during the generation of particular woodland mansion rooms. They do not respawn after their initial spawn.

                Evokers spawned with mansions do not naturally despawn (unless the world is switched to Peaceful mode‌[JE only]).

                They may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.‌[JE only]
                Raids

                Evokers can spawn during raids by themselves or riding Ravagers.
                Java Edition

                Evokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5. Up to 5 evokers spawn on Hard difficulty. During these events, they can be a raid captain. On Hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding ravager at Wave 7.
                Bedrock Edition
                Up to 5 evokers spawn during raids, with 1 evoker spawning during waves 5 and 6, and 3 evokers spawning during wave 7. One of them rides a ravager during wave 7.

                Ghasts are large white floating jellyfish-like hostile mobs that live in the Nether which shoot explosive fireballs at the player.

            <spawn>
                To spawn naturally, ghasts require a solid block below them and 5×4×5 free space. They spawn only in the basalt deltas, nether wastes, and soul sand valley, all three of which exist only in the Nether dimension, and in any light level. In soul sand valleys, where only skeletons (endermen) and ghasts spawn, ghasts cannot spawn if another ghast is within 16 blocks of spherical distance to the intended spawning location.

                Ghasts do not spawn in nether fortresses, but they can come nearby. Their rarest spawn in nether fortresses is in lava well rooms (the "tentacles" do not require space, though, they may be stuck, unable to move).

            <descripcion>
                A guardian is a pufferfish-like hostile mob that spawn in and around ocean monuments. They attack players, axolotls, and squid with a laser beam that cannot be dodged or blocked by a shield. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Guardians spawn naturally in ocean monuments. They require water to spawn. Specifically, they can spawn only if the spawning block and the block below the spawning block are both water (regardless of stationary water or flowing water), and the block above the spawning block is transparent (air, water, sign, slab, ice, etc.).

                In Java Edition guardians spawn less often in ocean open to the sky than they do in covered areas (i.e. inside the monument). Specifically, spawning fails 95% of the time if the spawning water block is below sea level (Y=63 by default), all blocks between the spawning water block and sea level are liquid or fully transparent, and the block at sea level has a view of the sky. Above sea level, spawning fails 95% of the time if the spawning water block has a view of the sky.

                In Bedrock Edition, guardians are structure spawns, spawning on 25 pre-determined spawning spots. The x-coordinate of each spawning spot is X+2, X+13, X+29, X+45, or X+55, where X is the western edge of the monument. Similarly, the z-coordinate is Z+2, Z+13, Z+29, Z+45, or Z+55. They spawn on the northwest corner of the spawning spot block, meaning they can spawn inside of a portal and get instantly sent to the nether. If their sky access is obstructed by a solid block, the guardians spawn significantly faster. Like all structure spawns, guardians belong to the cave cap.

                Guardians spawn in between Y=39 (floor of the ocean monument) to Y=61 (1 block higher than the topmost block of the monument).

Despite being able to spawn in any light level, hoglins also cannot spawn on Shroomlights, which are a solid block. Hoglins are part of the hostile mob cap. However, in peaceful difficulty, hoglins that spawn still behave passively.

                They are found in areas of the Nether at all light levels. The space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids.

                Only sizes 1, 2, and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of /summon, magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 256 (NBT Size tag 0–255).

                Big magma cubes require a 3×2½×3 space to spawn, small magma cubes require a 3×2×3 space, and tiny magma cubes require a 1×2×1 space (or 1×1×1 if the upper block is not opaque).[1]

                Magma cubes' size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.

            <descripcion>
                Phantoms are common undead bat-like hostile mobs that spawn when the player has not slept for three or more in-game days. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Phantoms spawn unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false. The spawning mechanics differ between Java and Bedrock editions. In both editions, they spawn in the Overworld above the player if the "since last rest" statistic is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days). This statistic is reset when the player enters a bed, dies, or switches the doInsomnia gamerule from false to true. Furthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that blocks light in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0. Phantoms do not spawn in spectator mode,‌[JE only] but they do spawn in creative mode.
                Bedrock Edition

                Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap. Phantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5. Phantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters. However, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21 x 15 x 21 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.

                They are most common if the player is at Y=75.[1][verify]
                Java Edition

                Phantoms attempt to spawn every 1–2 minutes. They spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the local difficulty is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0. The chance of a successful spawn is x−72000⁄x, where x is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died. This roughly comes to a 1⁄4 (25.0%) chance on day 4, a 2⁄5 (40.0%) chance on day 5, a 3⁄6 (1⁄2) (50.0%) chance on day 6, 4⁄7 (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.

                If all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20–34 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a taxicab distance of up to 10 blocks. The number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in Easy difficulty, 1-3 in Normal, and 1-4 in Hard.

                Phantoms are counted toward the hostile mob cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning. Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular mob spawning.

            <descripcion>
                Pillagers are hostile illagers armed with crossbows that patrol the Overworld and participate in raids. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Patrols

                In Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol depends on the local difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain. Patrols occur after 51⁄2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in a world without generated structures. A patrol will spawn 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block. The individual pillagers of a patrol can only spawn at block light level 7 or lower, regardless of sky light.

                In Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns 2 to 5 pillagers on Easy and Normal difficulty, whereas on Hard difficulty, 80% of illagers spawned are pillagers and 20% are vindicators. One of these illagers is a patrol captain. After 51⁄2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.
                Outposts

                Pillagers continually spawn in a 72×54×72 block volume centered on the top floor. They may spawn on any valid opaque block as long as the sky light level is 11 or lower, and the block light level is 8 or lower, but can also spawn on grass or sand blocks regardless of block light level.

                In Bedrock Edition, pillagers spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner.
                Raids
                Pillagers are more common in the earlier waves, and decrease in number as the waves progress. Despite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total. One pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave. In Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.

                Java Edition

                Unridden ravagers spawn at wave 3, a ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at wave 5, and a ravager ridden by a vindicator spawns at wave 7. A ravager ridden by an evoker also spawns at wave 7.

                Shulkers are box-shaped hostile mobs found in end cities. They hide in their shell to blend in with surrounding purpur blocks and guard the city's various treasures. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Natural generation

                Shulkers spawn during the generation of end cities, which are located on the outer islands of the End. They usually spawn on the walls of the city and on end ships. They do not despawn naturally, even in Peaceful difficulty, and once killed, they do not respawn unless spawners are used.‌[until JE 1.17]
                Post-generation
                Information icon.svg
                This feature is exclusive to Java Edition 1.17.‌[upcoming]

                There is a chance that a new shulker of the same color will spawn when one shulker hits another shulker (or itself) with a shulker bullet.

                The following conditions need to be met:

                When the shulker has less then half its health remaining and gets hit, it can teleport without spawning a new shulker. The chance for its to happen is 25%. It uses the same process as described below. If the attempt fails, it continues with the spawn attempt.
                The hit shulker must have its lid open.
                The hit shulker needs to find somewhere to teleport. For this, it takes a random block in a 17×17×17 cuboid centered on the shulker and then checks if the block has a valid face to teleport to. If not it proceeds to try this up to 4 more times. If no valid face is found, the attempt fails.
                Each other shulker within 8 blocks of the hit shulker decreases the odds of success by 20%. When five or more other shulkers are nearby, no shulkers will spawn.

                If the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported.

                Skeletons are common undead hostile mobs equipped with bows. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Skeletons spawn at a light level of 7 or less in groups of 4 or 5 in the Overworld in Java and 1 to 2 in Bedrock. They can be found above solid blocks from biomes except mushroom fields. 80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky spawn as strays in snowy tundras, frozen oceans and variants.

                Spiders have a 1% chance to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.

                Four skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton trap is triggered. The skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.

                In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horsemen do not have immunity.
                Spawners

                Skeletons spawn from 25% of the spawners found in dungeons.
                Nether

                Some of them may spawn in fortresses, replacing 20% of wither skeletons.

                Skeletons are common in soul sand valleys, being found at a light level of 7 or less.

                Slimes are bouncy, cube-shaped, hostile mobs that spawn in the swamp and, occasionally, deep underground in particular chunks called slime chunks. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Slimes spawn in the Overworld in specific "slime chunks" below layer 40, regardless of light levels. They can also spawn in swamp biomes between layers 50 and 70 in light levels of 7 or less.

                Only sizes 1, 2, and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of /summon, slimes can potentially range from size 1 to 256 (NBT Size tag 0–255).

                Slimes do not spawn within 24 blocks (spherical) of any player, despawn over time if no player is within 32 blocks, and despawn instantly if no player is within the despawn radius (128 blocks in Java Edition, 44-128 blocks in Bedrock Edition depending on simulation distance).

                Slimes require two vertical, transparent blocks (such as air, signs, or torches, but excluding Redstone-related items[more information needed]) to spawn in, with an opaque block underneath. The space they spawn in must also be clear of solid obstructions and liquids.[more information needed] Big slimes require a 3×2.5×3 space to spawn, medium slimes require a 3×2×3 space, and small slimes require a 1×2×1 space (or 1×1×1 if the upper block is not opaque).[1]

                Slime size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.
                Swamps

                In swamps, slimes may spawn at night between the heights of 50 and 70 when the provided light level is 7 or less. They spawn most often on a full moon, and never on a new moon. Slimes spawn in the normal swamp, but not in any variants.

                More precisely, the game checks two factors:

                If the light level is equal to or less than a random integer (from 0 to 7)
                If the fraction of the moon that is bright is greater than a random number (from 0 to 1)

                If these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime.
                "Slime chunks"

                Slimes spawn throughout the world (except mushroom islands) below level Y=40 regardless of light level, but only in certain chunks; 1⁄10 of all chunks.
                Java Edition

                In Java Edition, these "slime chunks" are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the seed of the world:

                import java.util.Random; 

                public class checkSlimechunk{ 

                public static void main(String args[]) 
                { 
                // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal
                long seed = 12345L;
                int xPosition = 123;
                int zPosition = 456;

                Random rnd = new Random(
                seed +
                (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) +
                (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) +
                (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L +
                (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL
                );

                System.out.println(rnd.nextInt(10) == 0);
                } 
                }

                That is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated. If that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes. To convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down. Note that xPosition and zPosition are 32-bit integers (ints).
                Bedrock Edition

                The slime chunk algorithm in Bedrock Edition is different from in Java Edition. The algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.[2]

                import java.util.Random; 

                public class checkSlimechunk{ 

                public static void main(String args[]) 
                { 
                // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal
                long seed = 12345L;
                int xPosition = 123;
                int zPosition = 456;

                Random rnd = new Random(
                seed +
                (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) +
                (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) +
                (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L +
                (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL
                );

                System.out.println(rnd.nextInt(10) == 0);
                } 
                }

                That is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated. If that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes. To convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down. Note that xPosition and zPosition are 32-bit integers (ints).
                Bedrock Edition

                The slime chunk algorithm in Bedrock Edition is different from in Java Edition. The algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.[2]

            <descripcion>
                Slimes are bouncy, cube-shaped, hostile mobs that spawn in the swamp and, occasionally, deep underground in particular chunks called slime chunks. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Slimes spawn in the Overworld in specific "slime chunks" below layer 40, regardless of light levels. They can also spawn in swamp biomes between layers 50 and 70 in light levels of 7 or less.

                Only sizes 1, 2, and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of /summon, slimes can potentially range from size 1 to 256 (NBT Size tag 0–255).

                Slimes do not spawn within 24 blocks (spherical) of any player, despawn over time if no player is within 32 blocks, and despawn instantly if no player is within the despawn radius (128 blocks in Java Edition, 44-128 blocks in Bedrock Edition depending on simulation distance).

                Slimes require two vertical, transparent blocks (such as air, signs, or torches, but excluding Redstone-related items[more information needed]) to spawn in, with an opaque block underneath. The space they spawn in must also be clear of solid obstructions and liquids.[more information needed] Big slimes require a 3×2.5×3 space to spawn, medium slimes require a 3×2×3 space, and small slimes require a 1×2×1 space (or 1×1×1 if the upper block is not opaque).[1]

                Slime size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.
                Swamps

                In swamps, slimes may spawn at night between the heights of 50 and 70 when the provided light level is 7 or less. They spawn most often on a full moon, and never on a new moon. Slimes spawn in the normal swamp, but not in any variants.

                More precisely, the game checks two factors:

                If the light level is equal to or less than a random integer (from 0 to 7)
                If the fraction of the moon that is bright is greater than a random number (from 0 to 1)

                If these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime.
                "Slime chunks"

                Slimes spawn throughout the world (except mushroom islands) below level Y=40 regardless of light level, but only in certain chunks; 1⁄10 of all chunks.
                Java Edition

                In Java Edition, these "slime chunks" are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the seed of the world:

                import java.util.Random; 

                public class checkSlimechunk{ 

                public static void main(String args[]) 
                { 
                // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal
                long seed = 12345L;
                int xPosition = 123;
                int zPosition = 456;

                Random rnd = new Random(
                seed +
                (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) +
                (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) +
                (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L +
                (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL
                );

                System.out.println(rnd.nextInt(10) == 0);
                } 
                }

                That is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated. If that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes. To convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down. Note that xPosition and zPosition are 32-bit integers (ints).
                Bedrock Edition

                The slime chunk algorithm in Bedrock Edition is different from in Java Edition. The algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.[2]

                Strays are variants of skeletons that spawn only in frozen, ice, or snowy biomes. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Skeletons spawned directly under the sky in Snowy Tundra, Snowy Mountains, Ice Spikes, Frozen River, Frozen Ocean,‌[BE only] Deep Frozen Ocean‌[BE only] and Legacy Frozen Ocean‌[BE only] biomes have an 80% chance of being strays.

                Strays do not spawn naturally from monster spawners, even when exposed to direct sky in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, 1% of spiders and cave spiders can spawn as a spider jockey with 80% chance to be a stray spider jockey or stray cave spider jockey.

                When a skeleton is kept inside powder snow it converts into a stray after 45 seconds (900 game ticks).‌[upcoming: JE 1.17]

                The stray has its own spawn egg in the creative inventory.

                Vexes spawn as part of an evoker's summoning attack; the evoker signals this attack by producing off-white smoke and a high-pitched horn-like sound. When summoned, exactly three vexes appear near the evoker. An evoker can summon additional vexes even if some still remain alive from the last summoning.

                A vindicator is an illager equipped with an iron axe. Vindicators appear in woodland mansions and participate in raids. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                On Normal difficulty and Hard difficulty, vindicators sometimes spawn with a randomly enchanted iron axe: the chance is 0–25%, and is higher when the regional difficulty is higher.
                Woodland mansions

                Vindicators spawn during the generation of mansions, inside particular rooms. Some rooms contain 1, others contain 3, some contain 2 accompanied by an Evoker, and some can rarely spawn in the corridors.

                They do not respawn after initially spawning. Vindicators generated with mansions do not naturally despawn (unless the world is switched to Peaceful difficulty ‌[JE only]).

                Patrols consist of 2–5 Illagers, with all Illagers always being Pillagers on Easy difficulty and Normal difficulty. On Hard difficulty, 80% of them are pillagers and 20% of them are vindicators.‌[BE only]

                A witch is an uncommon hostile mob that uses harmful splash potions as ranged weapons and beneficial potions on itself defensively. Witches also spawn during raids, in Java Edition they then throw healing splash potions at illagers. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Natural generation

                Solitary witches spawn in the Overworld at a light level of 7 or less. It spawns in all land biomes except mushroom fields. Witches are the least common of the non-biome-specific monsters.
                Swamp huts

                Every swamp hut spawns a witch and a black cat inside during world generation, which never despawn. Otherwise, in Java Edition only witches (which may despawn) spawn in the 7×7×9 (x×y×z) volume that is the hut. This is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof. In Bedrock Edition, witches respawn on only one block within the swamp hut.[more information needed]
                Villagers

                When lightning strikes within 4 blocks of an adult villager or baby villager, it transforms into a witch. Witches transformed in this way cannot despawn, nor can they be changed back into villagers.
                Raids
                Witches can spawn as part of raids starting from wave 4 in Bedrock Edition, or wave 3 or 4 in Java Edition depending on the world difficulty. They throw potions of healing at illagers.

                Zombies are common undead hostile mobs that attack players, villagers, wandering traders, iron golems, snow golems, and baby turtles. They also stomp on turtle eggs. They burn in sunlight, similar to most other undead mobs.

                Naturally

                In the Overworld, zombies can spawn in groups of 4 on any solid block at a light level of 7 or less.

                In deserts, all zombies exposed to the sky have an 80%‌[JE only] / 70%‌[BE only] chance to be replaced by husks, a zombie variant. Zombies that are not husks or drowned have a 5% chance to spawn as a zombie villager, while all zombie variants also have a 5% chance to spawn as a baby zombie type.

                Despite being shorter than 1-block tall, baby zombies require a 2-block tall space to spawn.

                Baby zombies have an additional 5% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey.‌[JE only] When spawning, a baby zombie may spawn on top of a nearby chicken. ‌[JE only]

                Baby zombies have a 15% chance to want to be a jockey, and if they do, then upon nearing the player and before attacking, they check for one of the following and mount it: adult zombies, chickens, sheep, cows, pigs, llamas, ocelots, foxes, pandas, mooshrooms, untamed cats, untamed wolves, horses and variants, spiders and cave spiders.‌[BE only]

                A zombie can also spawn from a husk that drowns in water but converts to a drowned if its head remains submerged.

                If a player is in a village with at least 10 beds and 20 villagers at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned near the edge of the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. If a player is in a village with at least 20 beds and 40 villagers at midnight, up to 40 zombies may be spawned near the edge of the village. If a player is in a village with at least 30 beds and 60 villagers at midnight, up to 60 zombies may be spawned near the edge of the village, and so on. It can happen in any biome except the Mushroom Fields biome and its variants.

                Zombie villagers are variants of zombies that can be cured into normal villagers using golden apples and under the effect of Weakness.

            <spawn>
                When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition only]

                If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager. If the villager has previously been traded with, this zombie villager does not despawn when the player moves far away from it.
                Chance for villagers killed by zombies to turn into zombie villagers Difficulty
                Easy: 0%
                Normal:	50%
                Hard: 100%

                A cleric zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement. One of them transforms into leatherworker, due to the workstation. They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

                Zombie villagers have their own spawn egg, which can be found inside the creative inventory. This spawn egg spawns a zombie villager when used.

                Zombie villagers are variants of zombies that can be cured into normal villagers using golden apples and under the effect of Weakness. 
                Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They behave similar to regular zombie villager, with some oddities.
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition only]

                If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager. If the villager has previously been traded with, this zombie villager does not despawn when the player moves far away from it.
                Chance for villagers killed by zombies to turn into zombie villagers Difficulty
                Easy: 0%
                Normal:	50%
                Hard: 100%

                A cleric zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement. One of them transforms into leatherworker, due to the workstation. They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

                Zombie villagers have their own spawn egg, which can be found inside the creative inventory. This spawn egg spawns a zombie villager when used. 

                            
                Baby Zombies
                All mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.

                Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They behave similar to regular zombie villager, with the following oddities:

                They are 30% faster than the normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies. This makes the baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.
                The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.
                They can sometimes ride chickens. They can also ride‌[Bedrock Edition only]:
                Cows
                Ocelots
                Wolves
                Mooshroom
                Adult chickens
                Pigs
                Sheep
                Horses
                Donkeys
                Mules
                Zombie horses (unused jockey variant)
                Skeleton Horses
                Adult zombies
                Adult zombie villagers
                Pandas
                Adult husks
                Adult zombified piglins
                Stray cats
                Spiders
                Cave spiders
                It moves at the baby zombie villager's speed, instead of the mob's speed.
                If riding a neutral mob, it becomes hostile, but does not anger any mobs nearby that are the same mob as they are.
                If a baby zombie is riding a mob that is also rideable by a player, that mob becomes non-rideable by a player.
                A baby zombie has a 15% chance to become a jockey when try attacking villagers, players or golems.
                Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.
                Worn armor shrinks to fit their body size.
                They are able to fit through 1×1 block gaps.
                They drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.
                Unlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into "adult" zombie villagers.
                They have a decreased hitbox size.

                Baby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers × 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.

                The Ender dragon spawns immediately when a player first arrives in the End.
                Re-summoning
                Players can re-summon the Ender dragon once the fight is over by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side. When the dragon is re-summoned, a series of explosions resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals. The top of each pillar appears to explode, destroying any player-placed blocks. If the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears</spawn>

            <descripcion>
                The wither is an undead hostile boss mob that floats and shoots explosive skulls at players and mobs. It is the only player-made hostile mob in the game.

                The wither drops 50 experience points and a nether star, a crafting ingredient for beacons. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                The wither is spawned by placing 4 blocks of Soul Sand and/or Soul Soil in a T shape (see image to the left), and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the three upper blocks. The last block placed must be one of the three skulls and can be placed by the player or a Dispenser. Air blocks are required on either side of the base soul sand or soul soil under the upper blocks (non-solid blocks such as Grass and flowers prevent the wither from spawning). The building pattern can have any orientation (including horizontal and upside-down) as well as the skulls; the wither always spawns at the foot of the pattern. When the wither has successfully spawned, it is angered and creates an explosion around itself.

                Like other hostile mobs, the wither despawns when the difficulty is changed to Peaceful. Building the wither spawning structure in Peaceful difficulty does not spawn anything.

            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                Axolotls do not currently spawn naturally, being available only from buckets or spawn eggs in the Creative inventory. They can also be obtained by the /summon command. Axolotls despawn over time if not spawned by a bucket.

                In a future version, axolotls will be found in lush caves.
                Colors
                Axolotls can be one of five colors: pink (leucistic), brown (wild), gold, cyan, and blue. The blue variety is has a 1⁄1200 (0.083%) chance, giving the common varieties a 1199⁄4800 (~24.98%) chance individually. 
                Axolotls picked up and re-spawned with a bucket do not preserve their color.[1] Baby axolotls picked up and re-spawned with a bucket do not preserve their growth stage and turn into an adult.

            <descripcion>
                Giants are unused, over-sized versions of zombies that do not spawn naturally. They used to spawn naturally in indev. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                No biome includes giants on their spawn lists, so they can never spawn naturally. The earliest available Infdev build (June 18, 2010) does not include Giants in the global spawn list.

                Additionally, giants simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8. This effectively makes it impossible to make them appear through mob spawners.
                Commands
                Giants can be spawned using commands such as /summon minecraft:giant.

                The killer bunny (previously known as The killer rabbit of caerbannog, a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail) is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile to all players. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.

            <spawn>
                It can be spawned only by using the /summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading "The Killer Bunny".

                Illusioners have no spawn egg in the creative inventory. They can be spawned only using the /summon illusioner command.

                Unlike other illagers, illusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions, raids or pillager outposts. Similar to the unused giant mob, they do not naturally spawn in any biome.

                Villagers were passive mobs that inhabit villages, with different professions, breed, and interact. Their clothing varied according to their occupation.

                Natural generation

                In Java Edition, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14. In Bedrock Edition, old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to 1.11.0, and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world will be converted into villager_v2.
                Baby villagers

                Villagers will breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers. After exactly 20 minutes, the baby villager will grow up to an adult. See this section for more information.
                Curing
                Villagers will spawn if a player uses a splash potion of weakness on a v1 zombie villager in template world and then feeds it a regular golden apple. It will then shake and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes. During the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.

                Zombie villagers are variants of zombies that can be cured into normal villagers using golden apples and under the effect of Weakness. 
            </descripcion>
            <spawn>
                When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition only]

                If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager. If the villager has previously been traded with, this zombie villager does not despawn when the player moves far away from it.
                Chance for villagers killed by zombies to turn into zombie villagers Difficulty
                Easy: 0%
                Normal:	50%
                Hard: 100%

                A cleric zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement. One of them transforms into leatherworker, due to the workstation. They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

                Zombie villagers have their own spawn egg, which can be found inside the creative inventory. This spawn egg spawns a zombie villager when used.

                Zombie villagers are variants of zombies that can be cured into normal villagers using golden apples and under the effect of Weakness. 
                Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They behave similar to regular zombie villager, with some oddities.

            <spawn>
                When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌[Bedrock Edition only], or a single zombie villager.‌[Java Edition only]

                If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager. If the villager has previously been traded with, this zombie villager does not despawn when the player moves far away from it.
                Chance for villagers killed by zombies to turn into zombie villagers Difficulty
                Easy: 0%
                Normal:	50%
                Hard: 100%

                A cleric zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement. One of them transforms into leatherworker, due to the workstation. They also generate as part of abandoned villages. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

                Zombie villagers have their own spawn egg, which can be found inside the creative inventory. This spawn egg spawns a zombie villager when used. 

                            
                Baby Zombies
                All mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.

                Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They behave similar to regular zombie villager, with the following oddities:

                They are 30% faster than the normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies. This makes the baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.
                The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.
                They can sometimes ride chickens. They can also ride‌[Bedrock Edition only]:
                Cows
                Ocelots
                Wolves
                Mooshroom
                Adult chickens
                Pigs
                Sheep
                Horses
                Donkeys
                Mules
                Zombie horses (unused jockey variant)
                Skeleton Horses
                Adult zombies
                Adult zombie villagers
                Pandas
                Adult husks
                Adult zombified piglins
                Stray cats
                Spiders
                Cave spiders
                It moves at the baby zombie villager's speed, instead of the mob's speed.
                If riding a neutral mob, it becomes hostile, but does not anger any mobs nearby that are the same mob as they are.
                If a baby zombie is riding a mob that is also rideable by a player, that mob becomes non-rideable by a player.
                A baby zombie has a 15% chance to become a jockey when try attacking villagers, players or golems.
                Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.
                Worn armor shrinks to fit their body size.
                They are able to fit through 1×1 block gaps.
                They drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.
                Unlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into "adult" zombie villagers.
                They have a decreased hitbox size.

                Baby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers × 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.
